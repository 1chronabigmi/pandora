## What is .NET Framework?
 
.NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that provides a common platform for building and running applications that use .NET technologies, such as Windows Forms, ASP.NET, WPF, WCF, LINQ, and more. .NET Framework consists of two main components: the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the .NET Framework Class Library (FCL).
 
The CLR is the execution engine that manages memory allocation, garbage collection, exception handling, security, threading, and interoperability with other languages and platforms. The FCL is a collection of reusable classes, interfaces, and structures that provide functionality for common tasks such as data access, networking, cryptography, file I/O, XML processing, and more.
